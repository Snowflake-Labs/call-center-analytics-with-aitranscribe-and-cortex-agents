# Call Center Analytics with AI_TRANSCRIBE and Cortex Agents

## Overview
This quickstart demonstrates how to build a comprehensive call center analytics solution using Snowflake's AI_TRANSCRIBE function and Cortex Agents. The solution processes audio files from call centers to extract transcripts, analyzes call content using Cortex LLM functions, and provides intelligent insights through a Streamlit application. We showcase end-to-end audio analytics from speech-to-text conversion to interactive dashboards with natural language querying capabilities powered by Cortex Agents.
